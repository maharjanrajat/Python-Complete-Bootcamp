# Break Statement
- break statement is used to terminate a loop
- It is used inside a loop
- When a break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is terminated and the control is passed to the next statement after the loop

### Syntax:
```python
while condition:
    # code to be executed if condition is true
    if condition:
        break
```

### Example 1:
```python
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    if i == 3:
        break
    i += 1
```

### Real world use case of break statement:
- Search for an element in a list
- If the element is found, stop searching

```python
numbers = [10, 18, 21, 17, 91]
search_number = 17

for number in numbers:
    if number == search_number:
        print("Number found")
        break
else:
    print("Number not found")
```

### Input Validation:
Continue to ask for input until the user enters a valid positive number

```python
while True:
    number = input("Enter a positive number: ")
    if number.isdigit() and int(number) > 0:
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid input ‚ùå. Please enter a positive number")

print("The number is: ", number)
```


# Continue Statement
- continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop

### Syntax:
```python
while condition:
    # code to be executed if condition is true
    if condition:
        continue
```

### Example 1:
```python

for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
```

### Real world use case of continue statement:
- Print all the odd numbers in a list

```python
numbers = [10, 18, 21, 17, 91]

for number in numbers:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(number)
```

# Pass Statement
- pass statement is used to do nothing
- It is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute

### Syntax:
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        pass
    print(i)
```

### Real world use case of pass statement:

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        pass
    print(i)
```
